                Within the sweeping vista of the digital landscape defining today's business horizons, the term digital marketing represents a very power play-which can transcend geography and touch audience impressions at scales previously unimaginable. Essentially, digital marketing means an umbrella of online tactics, ranging from social media promotion to content marketing, search engine optimization, and email outreach. From outside the confines of traditional promotional methods:
                Digital marketing then comes out as the aggressive pursuit of sustainability and brand promotion and customer engagement come together to create symbiosis between profit and purpose, finally.
                
                
                The article goes on to explore and delve deep into the dynamic junction between digital marketing and sustainability through how online platforms can be utilized by businesses not only in enhancing their brand image but also driving meaningful impacts on environmental and social fronts. It quickly and clearly becomes abundantly clear that the pursuit of sustainability is not a choice anymore, but rather the foundation of success in business in the longer term.
                Digital marketing as a tool for promoting the sustainability agenda
                Digital marketing makes sustainability initiatives by engaging multiple strategies. It is a form of storytelling: an intermediary through which businesses can speak their commitment to sustainable practices. Companies no longer need just demonstrate their efforts on issues like environment and social responsibility but also communicate with the consumer on levels beyond that traditional rhetoric in marketing. The
                The interactive nature of digital platforms allows for consumers to be engaged simultaneously, thus providing a tool for businesses to create education and engagement among their target audience regarding sustainable initiatives.
                From disseminating the information concerning the environmental-friendly product lines all the way to challenging customers to engage and participate in sustainability-driven campaigns, digital marketing fosters shared responsibility and community involvement. The data-driven nature of digital marketing allows businesses
                To measure and communicate the tangible impact of their sustainability undertakings. With analytics and metrics, companies are then able to clearly depict where they have cut carbon footprint, saved resources, or made good social contributions from which trust and credibility with an increasingly discerning consumer base can thus be built. As we begin this journey of the mutualism between digital marketing and sustainability, it stands to reason that the digital sphere is not only
                a marketplace but a platform for change. Then, we dive into the strategies and case studies that bring to life how businesses are using the transformative power of dig\\u0002ital marketing not only to boost their brand image but also contribute meaningfully to the global pursuit of a sustainable future [2].
                Current Sustainability Landscape
                Probably one of the hallmark trends on discourse in sustainability is the sense of desperate appeal and action for the climate. Faced with the increasingly dire shadow of climate change, companies are responding through reorienting strategies that are aligned with carbon footprint. Some of these include setting emission reduction targets while embracing renewable energy sources and an approach of environmental stewardship. Simultaneously, the idea of circular economies constantly transforms how
                Business approaches product lifecycles. There is a focus on developing products to last, to be recyclable, and so forth in order to create less waste and to encourage patterns of consumption that are more sustainable. 
                Social responsibility has gone from simply the act of charity and is becoming part of corpo\\u0002rate identity. Diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives are arising as businesses must ensure there is fair labor practice, equal opportunities and in community
                engagement. Transparency in the supply chain is a large trend these days as consumers and investors want to see through the sourcing practices, labor conditions, and ecological footprint of the products, to say the least. Lastly, the finance sector is also experiencing a shift in paradigm with the advent ofSustainability incorporated in investment decisions through channels like green bonds and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria [3].
                But sustainability is a journey with challenges. It is as hard to keep a straight course through a deep and dynamic sea of regulations as it is to hold a firm; the very way business operates varies by region and by industry. Differences in regulation by those regions and industries require sensitivities and adaptability. Finding a balance
                Profitability with purpose remains an ongoing challenge, as companies have to innovate and integrate sustainable practices without harming their financial performance. Supply chains face multifaceted risks ranging from the impact of climate change to geopolitical disruptions, thus calling for resilience and sustainability all along the value chain. Greenwashing concerns where a company exaggerates or outright misrepresents its environmental efforts underscore the issue of authenticity and transparency; access to capital for
                This is a challenge especially to the SMEs, thus creating imbalance that needs to be bridged. Closing the gap of sustainability adoption between the large corporates and SMEs will be fundamental for collective commitment to sustainability.
                As figure 1 illustrates, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations for 2030 are :
                The nations have framed a broad framework of practice to tackle the global issues. Their influence is up to consumer-level and farm-level marketing practices. Businesses use marketing strategies to execute SDGs that ensure sustainability, ethical sourcing, and responsible consumption. Businesses have enlightened consumers about their product's environmental and social impact, thus promoting sustainability.
                eco-friendly choices and promotion of sustainable living. At the farm level, SDGs help agricultural practices that are responsible resource managers, a good way to biodiversity, fair labor, and so on, as well as marketing at the consumer level is message about these sustainable practices of producing agriproducts and creating an attachment between consumers and the products produced and their origin and the fact that they are produced with environmental protection in mind. In both consumer and farm-level
                marketing, the SDGs can serve as an essential guiding framework that pushes towards a comprehensive approach to environmental, social, and economic dimensions for greater sustainability and inclusiveness inAmong these challenges lie opportunities for proactive businesses that embrace sus\\u0002tability. The business world now steers this complex terrain, and going forward, it is the businesses that can address challenges head-on and simultaneously explore opportunities that are not only part of the quest toward a more sustainable future but also building resilience to the global challenges. Sustainability is not just a company strategy but a journey towards a future where the businesses will thrive with sustained concomitant promotion of
                Positive environmental and social change [5].
                Eco-friendly products with the characteristics of sustainable sources, cuts in the environmental footprint, 
                and practice of circularity, have become popular. Consumers are indeed critically scrutinizing the ecological footprint of the products they buy, focusing on products with organic or Fair Trade status and labeled Energy Star. Charming powers indeed lie in biodegradable packaging, recyclable materials, and energy-using production processes for their purchasing decisions.
                The social responsibility of businesses is no longer a peripheral consideration but a key determinant in consumer choice. Companies that actively engage in fair labor practices, help the community, and serve to promote diversity and inclusion are becoming increasingly favored. Ethical consumption, speaking to human rights and social justice, is called upon by the consumer who sees his or her power as a buyer to be the stimulus for positive change.
                Consumers are no longer enough with marketing slogans; they now seek to know the truth. Brands
                transparency in communicating sustainable practice is key in winning the confidence of their audience. It is well established all along the supply chain from raw material sourcing to labor conditions. This backup helps cement a brand's commitment to 'eco-friendly and socially responsible practices [6].
                Brand reputation for environmental and social responsibility is closely tied to the result of a company }
                loyalty. Consumers will more likely be loyal to brands which reflect their values, building a long-term relationship based on trust and shared values. Sustainable firms not only attract new customers but also retain loyal customers, and thus, provide a stable base for long-term success.
                The change in consumer attitudes opens opportunities but poses challenges for businesses. It calls for satisfying the growing desire for eco-friendly and socially responsible products.
                innovation, which is often characterized by changes in sourcing, manufac- ing processes, and overall business operations. Companies have to negotiate the murkiness of certification processes as well as regulatory compliance with regard to sustaining their claims on sustainability.
                Then, we provide the trends on the use of digital marketing in solving sustainable development problems in the new landscape.
                Social Media Amplification:
                The social media is an unparalleled playfield where actual engagement happens, and businesses can HEAR
                Building a community engaged in sustainable practice. Companies can use social media to
                not only just state or broadcast their sustainability efforts but engage their audience. Campaigns,
                challenges, and interactive content provide means for a shared sense of responsibility
                to engage consumers in the sustainability journey. Virality
                Therefore, social messaging in media can ensure that sustainability-related messages reach huge audiences to create nationwide discussions as well as change public perceptions.
                
                Inﬂuencer Partnerships:
                Digital marketing provides avenues for inﬂuencer partnerships. Their partnership may help amplify the sustainability messages. Brands must collaborate with inﬂuencers who have a commitment to environmental and social causes. Their reach and authenticity can be leveraged for sustainability narratives. Such influencers may be positioned as_eco-conscious ambassadors, promoting sustainable lifestyle choices and responsible consumerism among their followers, thereby leading them \
                to mindful choices.
                Data-Driven Decision Making:
                One of the key advantages of digital marketing is that it is intrinsically data-driven. Analytics tools help businesses measure the effectiveness of their sustainability campaigns, engagement of consumers with the product or promotion, and successfulness of eco-friendly product launches. Since data-driven insights lead to continuous improvement, companies can adjust their strategies based on real-time feedback and consumer preference.
                Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):
                Digital marketing strategies can utilize immersive technologies such as VR and AR to connect with consumers through engaging and educational experiences about sustainability. Virtual tours of eco-friendly production facilities, augmented reality apps that describe sourcing product information, or immersive displays showing the good impact of sustainable choices enable consumers to relate with sustainability initiatives at a deeper level.
                Blockchain technology
                There is an enhanced use of blockchain technology in increasing supply chain transparency.
                The availability of an immutable and traceable
                record about the product journey from raw materials up to the final product can assure consumers that the product really is authentic in sustainable claims while at the same time creating trust through verifiable information about ethical sourcing, fair labor practices, and environmental impact.
                E-commerce sites for Green Products:
                E-commerce can be well combined with digital marketing to enlarge the reach and promotion of green products. Websites can host eco-friendly product lines alongside the certified accreditations accompanying them and even hint at environmental advantages. In this regard, online shopping marketplaces should create special green product sections to simplify choosing online green products for a buyer.
                
                A few firms have well proven the best practice of making sure that digital marketing strategies work hand in hand with sustainability programs. These have become notable for corporate practice. This includes global consumer goods giant Unilever, which has constantly communicated commitment to sustainability through the "Sustainable Living Plan." Through digital channels, Unilever ensured proper communication of its sustainability goals and achieved status. It shares the contents related to environmental friendly efforts via social media sites.
                Products, responsible sourcing, and waste reduction efforts are being promoted by Unilever, through its online campaigns, such as the Dove "Real Beauty" campaign; not only sustainable and accessible beauty standards but also consumer activation, creating a sense of community engagement around the sustainability mission of the brand.
                
                
                Tesla has been one of the most innovative electric vehicle companies, effectively using digital marketing for its sustainability. Its digital strategy brings out a brand image that evokes sensitive values to the environment. With well-designed and informative content through videos, blog posts, as well as interactive features on its website, Tesla will make the consumers familiar with issues concerning the environment in using electric vehicles. The company applies social media
                Platforms that should, from time to time, reach their audience with news on clean energy development, improvement on electric vehicle technology, and the need to adapt renewable transport. Teslas' digital marketing campaigns not only boost brand awareness but also drive public opinion and action toward becoming more sustainable in automotive industries.
                Patagonia is another very good example. It is an outdoor clothing and gear company that got famous for
                its environmental activism. The electronic marketing of Patagonia is all about
                storytelling to tell its story of sustainability and social responsibility. 
                Patagonia shares through its website, blog, and social networking sites stories of responsi\\u0002ble sourcing, fair labor practices, and environmental conservation. The company's "Worn Wear" program challenges them into buying used Patagonia products or trading their old
                items, demonstrates a potential by which the digital channels can be utilized to support the circular economy and idle less harm to the planet.
                But perhaps no campaign has had the same kind of positive environmental and social impact as Patagonia's "Don't Buy This Jacket" campaign. Patagonia ran a full-page advertisement on Black Friday in The New York Times. On Black Friday, millions of people hit stores looking for bargains
                the biggest shopping days of the year, reminding consumers they only should buy the jacket if they really need it. 
                The campaign was aimed to raise awareness about the environmental effects of over-consumption
                and challenged the consumer to think about the lifecycle of their product. Patagonia has been truthful
                and brazen in this approach, as it didn't just garner much attention but reiterated the commitment of the brand to
                sustainability. The company has continued this ethos with its "Worn Wear" program there by promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental impact of clothing waste
                
                Another remarkable campaign milestone was "Ice Bucket Challenge," which generated tremendous social influence and brought in the funds to a good cause. Although unrelated to environmental sustainability, this victory depends on how to use social media to make a viral phenomenon. The challenge required participants to dump an ice water bucket on
                in their heads, nominating others to do the same, and encouraging donations to support amyo\\u0002trophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research. Within a matter of weeks, the campaign went viral on social media sites and plat\\u0002forms, so that celebrities and influential people began to participate and challenge their followers. Not only did the "Ice Bucket Challenge" raise some major funds for ALS research, but it also demonstrated
                The Power of Social Media in Mobilizing People for Charitable Causes towards Creating Positive Social Changes across the World
                
                It would be appropriate to mention here the initiatives by IKEA towards corporate sustainability, in the form of "Sustainability Store".
                Considering the environmental impact of traditional brick-and-mortar outlets, IKEA has come up with
                A pop-up store on Main Street, Stockholm; the person could trade old furniture for a store
                credit, promoting a circular economy. The initiative aimed to reduce waste and encourage responsible consumption by refurbishment and reselling used furniture. This innovative strategy not
                not only aligned with IKEA's sustainability goals but was also testimony to the commitment of the company.

                The "Sustainability Store" received good media coverage and helped position IKEA as a pace setter in the furniture industry
                Data-Driven Sustainability
                The information from analytics is transforming business operations in how their operations measure and improve the impact of their sustainability practices. Data analytics means a lot to businesses concerning actionable insights derived for how effective their sustainability efforts are. 
                The analysis will consider key performance indicators and appropriate metrics, and companies will be able to get a broad idea of the impact that their initiatives are having on both the environment as well as society. In this way, for instance, data analytics can measure carbon emissions reduction, resource efficiency improvement, and progress toward sustainability goals overall, so organizations can measure tangible outcomes from the efforts made.
                Advanced software and even IoT devices provide digital technology with functionalities of real-time monitoring and data collection. IoT sensors can be introduced into supply chains, manufacturing processes, or energy systems to collect granular data on resource usage and environmental performance. That data can then be fed into analytics platforms to represent an end-to-end view of a company's sustainability footprint. By harnessing such
                This digital tool can detect the areas of improvement, optimize the use of resources and subsequently enable evidence-based decisions that work for maximum impacts on the sustainability initiatives.
                Predictive analytics is a very strong tool for taking advantage of data-driven sustainability solutions. By using historical data and advanced models for analytics, businesses are able to forecast future trends, allowing for insights into business changes, improving predictive analyses in terms of anticipating changes in demand and supply and adopting new strategies accordingly.
                and possible implications of their sustainability measures. This enables them to act proactively, shifting their strategies before changes or grabbing emerging opportunities. For example, predictive analytics can alert companies of shifts in customer preference for environment-friendly products such that they adjust their product offerings to stay ahead of customer preferences and emerging market trends. In addition, transparency
                Based on data analytics, trust with the stakeholders is developed. Open sharing of the relevant sustainability data makes business companies accountable and authentic. Reports and dashboards presenting the sustainability metrics and outlining the progress enable both internal and external stakeholders, such as consumers, investors, and regulatory bodies, to comprehend the impact of sustainability initiatives. Responsibility is developed because of this transparency.
                It fuels sustainable improvement because companies strive hard to achieve and surpass their sustainability goals before even the most astute consumers.
                The combination of data analytics and digital tools enables measuring sustainability impact and equips business organizations with the capacity to maximize their strategies for greater effect:
                Positive Results. From real-time monitoring through IoT devices to predictive analytics forecasting future trends, the synergy between data-driven insights and digital tools provides a holistic approach to sustainability management. The more that businesses realize the worth of such technologies, the more effectively they can clear the rather complex path of sustainability and contribute to an even more environmentally and socially responsible future.
                Some of the ways that companies can use the digital metrics in sustaining include tracking and reporting their progress in delivering sustainability outcomes. KPIs represent some of the critical performance indicators that give a way of quantifying many different aspects of environmental and social impact. For instance, business firms can use the digital metrics to apply reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and decrease energy and water consumption. Using advanced analytics tools,
                companies get instant perspectives of the success of their sustainability programs, thus allowing data-driven decisions and quick strategy changes [11].
                Digital metrics implementation is a strategic requirement for companies which would want to be able to track and report how they are doing on the sustainability fronts. The inclusion of analytics tools in companies allows them the accurate and timely insights in how their environment is going as well as more
                and social impact but also helps in transparency in the reporting of those metrics to diversified stake holders. Through embracing digital technologies, businesses not only portray themselves as stewards of sustainability but also as people who can provide great inspiration as other journeys further towards a more sustainable and responsible future forward.
                
                Challenges and Solutions
                The inculcation of sustainability into digital marketing campaigns is not without significant challenges. Here, green considerations intersect with the digital world.
                One of the key challenges arising here is the greenwashing challenge, or the art of passing off products as more green than they actually are.
                Countering the ever-growing vigilance of consumers and regulatory bodies, businesses must ensure that
                In order to establish that their sustainability claims are valid, grounded in concrete action and measurable results, they have to overcome the skepticism and build trust through open and verifiable communication strategy. Here, digital metrics play a significant role in proving efforts about sustainability.
                
                Transparency and authenticity are key in digital communication to build trust, especially with ecologically aware customers who look for real commitments to sustainability. In this age of information, it has become hard for consumers not to be discerning and much value is placed on companies open to their environmental practices. Companies that embrace transparency by sharing in-depth information about their sustainability initiatives, sourcing methods, and environmental impacts on digital platforms
                Build trust. Authenticity makes this trust grow, and therefore, companies must walk their digital words with real-life action. Digital media allow companies to immediately update their audiences on sustainability initiatives allowing them to share not only positive, but also negative developments and honest conversations about their efforts. Digital is a skeptical space because of greenwashing, but true openness builds a level of integrity, creating a base
                Building on trust that resonates strongly with environmentally sensitive consumers who are demanding accountability and responsible behaviour.
                Sustainability Regulatory Environment in Uzbekistan is slowly coming of age, aligning with the transition around the world towards greater environmental and social responsibility. In terms of legislation toward sustainability, there still remains much work to be done, but companies will need to be prepared for much more rigorous checks and need to alter their approach to accommodate this best. Businesses operating in Uzbekistan should
                keep track of any new rules that may introduce sustainability
                standards, such as guidelines for proper truthful advertisement as well as responsible business practice. Companies should embrace sustainability in their endeavors at digital marketing as truthfulness and authenticity will start to satisfy the expectations of an increasingly
                eco-aware customer base.
                Digital marketing strategies for Uzbekistan should be responsive to any regulatory measures specific to it.
                emerge regarding environmental claims, green marketing, or sustainability reporting. Being ethical and sustainable is important because regulatory bodies may enforce practices in accordance with international best practices. Greenwashing can also lead to reputation loss and legal consequences. Since the maturity of the regulations environment can be leveraged by businesses to exploit their digital channels not only for advertising but for clearly communicating their sustainability commitments, initiatives, and achievements. By
                Company-specific digital strategies can, therefore, be synchronized with emerging regulations. It will also allow companies in Uzbekistan to take corporate responsibility through consumer trust-building and contribute to the country's broader sustainability objectives [14].
                Technologies promising to transform industries and redefine the approach businesses take toward environmental and social responsibilities will shape the future of sustainability goals. Artificial intelligence is among the optimistically forecasted, which is set to optimize resource efficiency and reduce waste in various sectors through machine learning algorithms that can analyze vast datasets for patterns and suggest strategies.
                for effective practices, such as in supply chain management, energy consumption, or waste reduction. The more AI advances, the more organizations can harness its power to optimize operations, provide smarter decisions on quality data, and, overall, make a better performance in terms of sustainability [15].
                The Internet of Things (IoT) is believed to play the most significant role in achieving sustainability success
                by enabling the real-time monitoring and control of multiple processes. In a smart and interconnected environment, IoT devices can be able to monitor energy usage, trace emissions, and enhance the use of resources. For instance, with IoT-enabled smart buildings, energy usage can be controlled based on the presence of inhabitants, while intelligent transportation systems can help reduce fuel consumption by the control of traffic in real time. The data generated by the IoT devices can be
                It integrates with analytics platforms and provides business firms with actionable insight into fine-tuning their sustainability strategies. With ongoing technological advancement and strategic integration of innovative solutions, tremendous prospects exist for propelling businesses towards more ambitious and impactful sustainability goals in the future..</p>

                As this technological revolution gathers pace, digital poverty is eroding that achievement. This paper presents a just digital framework, considering the issue of equitable access to both digital capabilities, commodities, and infrastructures as well as governance towards reducing global inequality and furthering the SDGs.
                
                The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal, ambitious effort to identify grand challenges split into 17 goals that include specific sub-targets. Pursued in an integrated way, these goals could really make a difference to people's lives because this pursuit would "Leave No One Behind". The enthusiastic global support we received for these goals were a heart-warming assertion of the collective value we place on humanity and our shared commitment to act together. However, the technological progress in the last years posed a serious threat to their cumulative success, as UN Secretary-General pointed out during 2020; "Of the SDG's 17 goals and 169 targets, not a single one is detached from the implications and potential of digital technology…"1
                The digital divide is egregious to the ethos and the reality of achieving the SDGs. There is more than four billion people in emerging economies who are not connected to the internet2. The statistics reveal a shocking disparity of those who have access against those who have no access to the wealth that digital access brings. 50% of India's population has access to the internet even though India is home to the world's second biggest online market. And 66% of Caucasians have access to high-speed internet, while only 49% of African Americans have2. Digital access control amounts to power and may be dangerous. In recent times, governments or whistleblowers have shut down the internet or caused power outages in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Iran, and Myanmar for political or economic considerations3. Digital shutdowns limit people's access to life-saving information and restrict freedom of expression and association. They make it hard to organize opposition and cost economies billions. Now is the time for society to reflect on how these developments are impacting the attainment of SDGs and identify ways by which technological advances in the Fourth Industrial Revolution can be harnessed so that no one is left behind.
                Digital divide and realization of SDGs
                The sort of digital skills needed to work meaningfully with technology are a pre-requisite for achieving the SDGs. SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. Towards this objective, it aims at ensuring equal rights to economic resources for all men and women, in particular the poor and vulnerable. This last decade or so has shown that being digitally literate has been central to holding onto employment, education, and contact4. But COVID19 revealed an even more shocking reality-through a global pandemic: even the wealthiest economies failed to provide their citizens with the appropriate technologies and develop the required skills so they could meaningfully participate in their daily lives.
                
                Just as fast as digital access and new and astonishing digital technologies have accelerated learning and knowledge for many, the lack of access, commodities, and capabilities leaves behind many, many more4. It's not about having access to technology, but rather people lack the capabilities to use this technology properly to interact with the modern world. This is made possible by the increasing skills gap5 and lack of integrated digital systems that burdens economies, opens up space between the rich and the poor, and stops society from achieving SDG 1. According to Amartya Sen's Human Capabilities Approach6, human welfare derived from digital commodities depends not only upon ownership and access but also on what can be done with such goods. Society will have to supply digital goods, but it will also need to make available the digital competencies for people to benefit from this technological revolution-to access education (SDG 4), work (SDG 9), health (SDG 3), wealth (SDG 1), and security (SDG 16).
                
                SDG 9 Resilient infrastructures; include productive capacities; promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. But we are not equally enabled for the activity in modern society in a manner that fosters innovation and growth. In less than 20 years, access to commercial internet has become a requirement for full participation in society, and the digital economy itself has established a status as an ecosystem in its own right. That is to say, it has multiple stakeholders, whether the corporation or the government or NGOs or international organizations such as the United Nations. It is becoming increasingly dependent on the internet; therefore companies are coming up with newer services to cater to these needs, such as Internet of Things, the cloud, as well as machine-to-machine learning7, which would mean accessible digital infrastructure forms the cornerstone towards achieving the SDG 9.
                Looking at who gets meaningful access to emerging technologies and developing infrastructures we see a new face of inequality. For AI and blockchain technologies, there are vast opportunities to reduce inequalities. Probably the best-known application of blockchain so far is crypto-currency, which has been successfully used as an alternative financial sector in emerging economies8. It has also empowered people with health inequities to have secure access to their health records, telehealth, and reduced misinformation on medical drugs and vaccinations9. However, for one to fully benefit from blockchain, technical expertise is essential.
                Third world as well as developing nations have limited infrastructural access, therefore reducing inequalities. As a result, there is also an element of risk in being excluded from data sets that drive up-and-coming technologies. We have witnessed this with algorithms that map out sentences for criminals and not only favored against African Americans10 but also motion vision algorithms that no longer work as well on darker-skinned individuals. In the latter, light-skinned people dominated the data sets used to develop such algorithms. At present, there is no SDG that is dedicated to digital systems; indeed, only four refer explicitly to the potential impact emerging Information Communication Technology (SDGs 4, 5, 9, 17) can have on inequality and the overall achievement of the SDGs12. This, the European Commission has especially noted, warning that it risks entrenching historical inequalities in society, especially where gaps in data reflect class, gender, rac, or ethnic lines13.
                
                Digital technologies also provide access for financial inclusion, mobile banking, microcredits, remittances, and increase market access14. Alleviation of poverty effects are chiefly included, as the needs for vulnerable groups are highlighted through real-time analytics and data. Digital systems promote vulnerable populations to partner with and co-create solutions that service a variety of stakeholders. Increase access to information and services occurs through innovations in digital finance, e-commerce, and ethical e-governance. For example, while the rural-urban gap is gradually declining in China due to the utilization of e-governance to make health, education, and other sources of non-agricultural livelihood opportunities more accessible in rural areas12. In Bangladesh, iFarmer, a digital crowdfunding platform, facilitates rural women cattle farmers to access markets better as investors can extend them capital12. Simultaneously, livelihood among Cox Bazaar's Rohingya refugees is being designed on the e-commerce platform ekShop Shoron12.
                
                While digital skills are named in SDG 4, as a target that seeks to increase the number of people with relevant skills for employment7. These indicators only concentrate on relevant skills, while goods and infrastructures that affect the development and usage are ignored. And reflection on their growth based entirely on self-reported information of countries with analyses showing skewed data sets and reporting biases across gender groups, where women under and men overreport15.
                
                The Just Digital framework
                Proposing the Just Digital ethical framework to address the rapidly changing world and the increasingly growing role of the digital domain in daily lives to help push the SDG 2030 Agenda forward. Just Digital identified four target areas with associated indicators that can be used for sensing checks on their effects on attaining the SDGs and facilitating future success. Target areas of Just Digital: it has been implicated in all SDGs to varying degrees equity, education, employment, and engagement. The concept presupposes four interrelated digital concepts that, if emphasized and pushed throughout the rest of society, will ensure success in the targeted areas and equitable attainment of the SDGs. The four digital concepts include;
                1. Digital Infrastructure—a working system of communication that allows everyone to get online and work, go to school, and live remotely and more equitably. It enables people to access modern work and education and obtain representation within data algorithms being developed.
                
                2.
                Digital Capabilities-an education system that provides everyone with the capacity to navigate the digital world and to participate in education, the economy, and the social world. It should include all of society, especially those on its margins, and it should be an expectation for life-long learning-of continuing personal development.
                
                3.
                Digital Commodities-providing access to the hardware needed to participate in a basic standard of living.
                
                4.
                Digital Governance—an ecosystem to facilitate the incorporation of digital technologies into everyday life, so that there are national policies that are integrated, that protect citizens' rights, that entrench confidentiality and which are infused with ethical safeguards and security, not merely about individuals but also our duty to others, through digital social inclusion. This governance must consider both ethics of data infrastructure and ownership.
                
                Table 1 captures how the Just Digital framework weaves across existing targets for other SDGs and supports achievement in the four target areas at the center of the 17 SDGs. Target area one, equity, is implicated in several SDGs, including SDG 9 that targets innovation and SDG 10 that focuses on reducing inequalities. The cell in Table 1 working for the first example depicts how inequities across a number of SDGs are reduced. This means supporting SDG 10 reduction in inequalities and SDG 9 increased innovation. Using examples related to SDG 10, we can see in developing countries how lack of good digital infrastructure results in minority groups being absent from the data sets which underpin developing technologies. That puts in place unequal handling of features in how the AI systems are produced. With specific targets setting in place digital infrastructures across all of society, the chances of inequities are reduced; with access to digital infrastructures increased we can help ensure both light- and dark-skinned people are included in emerging AI10 that support the achievement of SDG 10. This is just one of the ways Just Digital can be used to reflect on how advances from digital can be used to progress core targets of the SDGs.
                
                Table 1 Reflective of how the Just Digital framework, in four key impact areas, can help facilitate targets and related SDG's.
                Table full size
                The Just Digital framework can buffer against all the socially corrosive effects of unequal achievement of the SDGs: currently leaving behind and oppressing the disconnected. The new approach offered by the Just Digital framework allows considering a different aspect in the achievement of the SDGs. It provides a lens through which to consider how the digital revolution can achieve such ethics in the attainment of these goals. Table 1 takes four target areas identified through analysis of the SDGs, and established key areas of the four interrelated digital concepts to ensure that the SDG 2030 Agenda is on track and that it is taking into consideration the digital revolution. Starting point Just Digital: a justice-oriented, ethical framework in a bid to help society reflect upon how and why digital is being used and what the likely consequences of its use are for society. Such reflection will ensure digital poverty is reduced, and help to ensure that the SDGs are harnessing the value of the technological revolution16,17.

                Abstract
                So far, academic research has not accounted for the entirety of the 17 SDGs within a larger context of sustainable development. This paper serves an independent analysis of the connection among institutions, SDG's, and digital technologies. This is to be able to identify the precise interdependencies at play. Factor analysis of grand challenges of sustainable development has revealed that only SDG3 and SDG 17 may advance via institution building in developed countries while SDG16, is the only one in developing countries. Institutions of human development, globalization and innovation, both in turn, contribute to influence SDG3 and SDG17, which rely on digitized knowledge, and the application of digital technologies. In developing countries, the ability of digital infrastructure and technologies to influence SDG16 depends on human development and economic freedom. An enhanced digital knowledge index as well as the digital technologies index contributes to improved management efficiency in developed countries where it would have maximal impact on SDG3 and SDG17. The findings of this paper contribute to social and economic policy implications about the development of digital technology for grand challenges.
                Introduction
                The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a unique stage in the history of humanity since the development of technologies becomes the basis for social mode and the progress of society entirely. This fact foregrounds the relevance of the consideration of digital technology's influence on SDGs as the imperatives of modern society's development. There is an ongoing scientific discussion in academic circles about the qualitative treatment of the power of digital technology development on SDGs and their prospects. Some researchers sharply criticize the impacts of digital technologies on sustainable development, considering, in regard to the traditionally high social and environmental costs of growth, the situation connected with digital change as negative. Digital technologies took one of the most important places in the sources of economic growth over the last decade [1] and will continue playing such a role in the future until 2030 [2] as well as, according to certain estimates, even until 2050 [3].
                The empirical data available to date indicate fundamental differences in the economic influence, including digital growth, in the sustainable development of developed and developing countries. Developed countries include a higher level of development of society and economy but a moderate (slower) rate of economic (and digital) growth [4]. The main social costs of digital economic growth in developed countries are connected to educating personnel through digital mass training. This cost raises social tension and competition between sellers in the labor market. Ecological costs are related to additional energy consumption since automatisation increases the energy intensity of production and consumption. However, these costs are successfully reduced by using the leading energy-intensive digital technologies, smart grid, and transition to alternative energy resources [5].
                Most vulnerable to the negative effects of digital economic growth, which is much stronger, are developing countries. They experience social costs in the form of increased unemployment, lower wages and living standards of the people, and ecological costs that manifest themselves in an increase in the volume of consumption of natural resources and formation of waste from production, which results in environmental degradation and quality of life deterioration [6].
                Other experts believe that the development of digital technology has a very pronounced positive effect on society in terms of sustainable development. Thus, digital technologies enable companies to increase their production abilities and fully satisfy public demand for goods and services. Digital finances ensure transparency and control of the economy; thus, they provide a stimulus for de-shadowisation. Opportunities are opened through access to digital training for the popularization of lifelong learning. The digital approach to the organization of added value chains allows for full-scale monitoring and guaranteeing the products' quality and on-time delivery [7].
                Advantages of digital technology development are more apparent in developed countries [8]. Social advantages are created in highly efficient, highly paid, knowledge-intensive, and more creative jobs. Ecological benefits for developing countries coming from eco-responsible innovations in digital sources enable more control over the environment and the environmental effects of production and distribution. Developing countries have social advantages regarding labour and social mobility, while ecological benefits are not well expressed.
                This is because the ongoing scholarly discourse inadequately elaborates on the quantitative impact of digital technology development toward the achievement of SDGs. Different aspects of digital technology development contribute differently toward the achievement of SDGs. Social institutions indirectly facilitate this influence. The result of digital technologies does not lead to a decrease in countries' inequality itself, but through the mediating role of increasing capabilities and increases in the transparency of financing, increase in accessibility of digital education, acceleration of innovative development, and stimulation of global competition through the stimulation of globalisation.
                Based on existing literature, this paper propounds the Hypothesis that digital technologies enable an improvement in the results or achievement of only some of the SDGs through their mediating effect with the support of enhancing institutional efficiency improvement: investments, human development, economic freedom, globalization, and innovations. Social and economic policy towards SDGs should be targeted for enhancing the quality of the institutional environment with technological advancement. Because institutional environment differences are one of the main accepted criteria of differentiation between developed and developing countries, influence from digital technologies on institutions and sustainable development depends on the country, and does therefore not apply in all, which requires an ad hoc management approach.
                The paper will target researching the top 10 developed and the top 10 developing countries, those that have yielded the best results in implementing the SDGs (see Annex 1) and their digital technology development perspectives to overcome the continuing grand challenges. The specificity and novelty of this research lie in each of the 17 SDGs. This helps in describing causal connections between developments in digital technology, together with the probability of success in each area. It is possible to perform profound analysis that will be giving opportunities for the identification of differences while progressing towards achieving different SDGs; identify difficult goals and find solutions through technological support.
                The paper makes several contributions. First, implicitly, it carries out research about influence on sustainable development by technological support from digital technology development. It is new. A direct influence, either not clearly expressed or absent, is not anticipated by the strategy to be searched. It allows starting research of the indirect effect under this new theoretical and methodological approach. The aspect would open an opportunity to prove that the development of digital technologies is pertinent to address the grand challenges of sustainable development.
                This paper presents a systemic view toward digital technology advancement for addressing the grand challenges of sustainable development, not derailed by negative nor positively biased influence. Thus, it would ensure the proper and fullest characterization of the impact of digital technologies on implementing the SDGs.
                Third, this paper expands and supports the institutional basis of digital technology development in order to address grand challenges of sustainable development. The progress in the implementation of the SDGs should be considered separately for developed and developing countries according to the specifics of the latter. For each category designated above, we present recommendations for the advancement of institutions' digital technologies to overcome the grand challenges of sustainable development.
                This paper is organized as follows:. Then comes the introduction, a literature review of the topic under study and an outline of the theoretical background, taking into consideration digital technology development as a socio-economic category, the scientific concept of the grand challenges of sustainable development, and gap analysis. This is followed by this paper's alternative method and its empirical basis for the research. The results would be as follows: 1. Factor analysis of a response to grand challenges of sustainable development, 2. Dependence of sustainable development factors on digital technology development, 3. Social and economic policy implications on digital technology development for addressing the grand challenges of sustainable development, 4. A systemic view on the prospects of addressing the grand challenges of sustainable development based on digital technology development. The conclusion synthesizes the contents of the paper by including the concepts, tools, and findings concerning the presented topic. It outlines the limitations and perspectives of future scientific studies on the influence of society's digital technology development for sustainability.

                Literature review
                Among the described works on socio-economic preconditions and consequences of digital technology advancement is the following one: Ghaffari et al. [9] demonstrate a socio-technical analysis of the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) as an interplay of technologies, tasks, structures, and actors; the IoT is one of the most critical manifestations of digital technology advancement. Scuotto et al. [10] also consider the IoT as one manifestation of digital technology advancement. According to scholars,

                Tseng et al. also carried out a literature review to identify a few findings concerning industrial symbiosis [40]. Recently, Popkova et al. [20] even developed a theory of digital technology advancement, which shows that digital developments would be expected to appropriately solve many problems and thus enable sustainable development. Resources might be more effectively utilized due to the implementation of digitalization in industries.</p>
